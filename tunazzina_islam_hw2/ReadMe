#To access PyTorch and Python 3.6+ in scholar cluster:

module load learning/conda-5.1.0-py36-gpu

#And then (I use 1.0.0)

module load ml-toolkit-gpu/pytorch/1.0.0


# Example Command

    python hw2_training.py data -i torch.nn


# I updated mnist.py according to Professor Ribeiro's Piazza post. If you are using an older version of torchvision, please replace mnist.py with the following code given by professor.


# Command to implement Feedforward Neural Network with Autograd (Question 2)

	python hw2_training.py data -i torch.autograd


# Learning Curves: Deep vs Shallow network (Question 3)
# I have a different python file for the network named networks_lc.py. I import this one in hw2_learning_curves.py. I added argument -c in command line to choose network whether it is deep or shallow.

# command for deep network

	python hw2_learning_curves.py data -i torch.autograd -c 1


# command for shallow network

	python hw2_learning_curves.py data -i torch.autograd -c 0


# Command to implement Backpropagation from Scratch (Question 4)

	python hw2_training.py data


# Command for learning curves (Question 4)

# command for deep network

	python hw2_learning_curves.py data -c 1


# command for shallow network

	python hw2_learning_curves.py data -c 0


#I have attached the Question 1, plots, Analysis on report.
